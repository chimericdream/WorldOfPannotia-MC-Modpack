## World of Pannotia Minecraft Modpack

![v2.0.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-2.0.0-green.svg) ![MC Version 1.10.2](https://img.shields.io/badge/MC%20Version-1.10.2-blue.svg)

The World of Pannotia modpack for Minecraft includes mods that appeal to various styles of game play. From Botania's magic system, to Applied Energistics 2, to end-game mods like Draconic Evolution, there is something for everyone. It is influenced heavily by packs such as DireWolf20 and the FTB Infinity Lite pack.

This modpack is a continual work in progress. We occasionally will add a mod or tweak a recipe. But overall, the pack is stable and quite fun to play. Enjoy!
